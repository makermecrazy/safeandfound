# Safe & Found
*Privacy-preserving recovery coordination for lost items*

## What this is
Safe & Found explores a safer, kinder way to reunite lost items with their owners — without forcing finders or owners to reveal personal information or locations.

This repository is a **living concept + validation space**.  
Nothing here is final. Everything here can evolve.

## The problem
Today, when someone finds a lost item:
- Returning it can feel risky or invasive
- Existing “lost & found” tools are fragmented
- Device-level trackers focus on location, not recovery coordination
- Good people often give up because it’s too complicated

## The idea (high level)
Create a **neutral recovery relay** that:
- Protects both finder and owner
- Supports verified drop-off or shipping
- Works across ecosystems (not just one brand)
- Rewards kindness instead of exploiting it

## What this repo will contain
- Concept notes and drafts
- Diagrams and flows
- Validation questions and poll results
- MVP scope (non-Apple-dependent)
- Future ideas (clearly marked as later)

## Project status
**Phase:** Early concept + validation  
**Current focus:** clarity, simplicity, and learning

## Guiding principles
- Privacy first  
- Safety over speed  
- Kindness should be easy  
- Start small, expand carefully
