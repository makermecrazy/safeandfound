# Safe & Found — Project Notes
*Living notes for concept development, questions, and validation*

---

## Why this exists
This file is a running brain-dump and thinking space for the Safe & Found project.

It is intentionally informal.
It will change often.
Nothing here is final.

---

## Core idea (working)
A privacy-first recovery relay that helps lost items safely make their way back to their owners — without forcing finders or owners to share personal information, locations, or contact details.

---

## Problems observed
- Returning found items can feel risky or invasive
- Many people want to help but don’t know how
- Existing lost & found systems are fragmented and manual
- Device trackers focus on location, not recovery coordination
- Kindness currently requires effort and trust without support

---

## Early assumptions (to validate)
- People would return items more often if the process felt safe
- Finders want a neutral third party to handle handoff
- Owners prefer recovery over replacement when possible
- Institutions want fewer lost-item disputes and labor costs

---

## Open questions
- What drop-off locations feel safest to most people?
- What level of verification feels “enough” without being invasive?
- Would people use this without rewards?
- Where does this fit alongside existing tools like Find My?

---

## Ideas to explore later (parking lot)
- Finder rewards or recognition (opt-in)
- “Wall of Heroes” concept
- Insurance partnerships
- Campus or airport pilots
- Cross-platform support (Apple, Android, non-smart items)
- Toy or child-item tracking (future, not now)
